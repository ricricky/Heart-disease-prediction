# Heart-disease-prediction
project on heart disease prediction using machine learning
My first machine learning project.. here in this project the heart disease prediction is been done on of a particular dataset whether the person has absence/presence of heart disease basis on their data related to their health... the logistic regression is been used in this project which  is used for   binary classiification  0,1 .. further testing and training of model and then finding the accuracy score of the model and in the last the particular predictive system is been built to get the result for an individual dataset ...
libraries needed for this project are - numpy,pandas,seaborn ...and a IDE (jupyter suggested).... 
language - python
